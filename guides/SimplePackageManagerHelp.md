This is the Documentation for `SimplePackageManager` script. The biggest script in this repo so far. It has the most packages so i'll go over all them in this breakdown.

#### [`Discord`](https://discord.com) A proprietary all-in-one voice and text chat.

Made possible by the [Chrultrabook](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs) community, it enables audio on [compatible](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/firmware/supported-devices.html) chromebooks running linux. Pretty nice tool. :3

# Documentation for the `SimplePackageManager.sh` script.

This is the Documentation for `SimplePackageManager` script. The biggest script in this repo so far. It has the most packages so i'll go over all them in this breakdown.

#### [`Discord`](https://discord.com) Discord is a messaging app/social media service. I won't be explaining too much since it is on their website.
#### [`Spotify`](https://spotify.com) A proprietary music streaming service.
#### [`Thorium Browser SSE3 and AVX2`](https://thorium.rocks) A fork of Chromium that aims for speed. SSE3 for older CPUs and AVX2 for newer CPUs, use [`CPU-X`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cpu-x) which will be covered later to find out what CPU you got.
#### [`Steam`](https://steampowered.com/) A proprietary game launcher.
#### [`Retroarch`](https://www.retroarch.com/) An open source emulation app for *almost* every console.
#### `Bluetooth` (arch systems). This option installs a few packages to get bluetooth working on Arch based systems. These packages are: [`bluez`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bluez/), [`blueman`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/blueman/), and [`bluez-utils`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bluez-utils/). This FINALLY allows you to use blueooth on your arch system if you've been having issues with that. It's a life saver.
#### [`CPU-X`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cpu-x) Views information about your CPU's tempurature and technologies.
#### [`VSCodium`](https://vscodium.com) An open source alternitive Microsoft's closed source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with telemetry from microsoft removed.
#### [`chromebook-linux-audio`](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio/) Only applies to chromebooks with Linux on it. Made possible by the [Chrultrabook](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs) community, it enables audio on [compatible](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/firmware/supported-devices.html) chromebooks running linux. Pretty nice tool. :3
#### [`Octopi`](https://tintaescura.com/projects/octopi/) It's a package manager for Archlinux using the `pacman` frontend. It offers a GUI to work with packages (and is way better than pamac imo).

That's everything this script has to offer.

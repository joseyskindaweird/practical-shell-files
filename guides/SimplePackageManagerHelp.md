# Documentation for the `SimplePackageManager.sh` script.

This is the Documentation for `SimplePackageManager` script. The biggest script in this repo so far. It has the most packages so i'll go over all them in this breakdown.

#### [`Discord`](https://discord.com) A proprietary all-in-one voice and text chat.
#### [`Spotify`](https://spotify.com) A proprietary music streaming service.
#### [`Libreoffice`](https://www.libreoffice.org/) An open-source alternitive to Microsoft Office.
#### [`Thorium Browser`](https://thorium.rocks) A fork of Chromium that aims for speed and privacy.
#### [`Steam`](https://steampowered.com/) A proprietary game launcher.
#### [`Retroarch`](https://www.retroarch.com/) An open source emulation app.
#### [`Bluetooth`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) (arch systems). This option installs a few packages to get bluetooth working on Arch-based systems. These packages installed are: [`bluez`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bluez/), [`blueman`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/blueman/), and [`bluez-utils`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bluez-utils/).
#### [`CPU-X`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cpu-x) Views information about your CPU's tempurature and technologies.
#### [`VSCodium`](https://vscodium.com) An open source alternitive to Microsoft's closed source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with telemetry from microsoft removed.
#### [`Chromebook-Linux-Audio`](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio/) Only applies to chromebooks with Linux on it. Made possible by the [Chrultrabook](https://chrultrabook.github.io/docs) community, it enables audio on [compatible](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/firmware/supported-devices.html) chromebooks running linux. Pretty nice tool. :3
#### [`Octopi`](https://tintaescura.com/projects/octopi/) It's a package manager for Archlinux using the `pacman` frontend. It offers a GUI to work with packages (and is way better than pamac imo).
#### [`Mercury`](https://thorium.rocks/mercury) A fork of Firefox that aims for speed and privacy.
#### [`Github Desktop`](https://github.com/desktop) A simplified GUI for creating and managing Github repos.
#### [`Brave`](https://brave.com) A browser aimed at privacy. (supposedly)
#### [`Google Chrome`](https://google.com/chrome) A bloated, spyware filled browser. (not recommended for use)
#### [`Chromium`](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) The open source Google Chrome, however still bloated.
#### [`Firefox`](https://firefox.com) A bloated, telemetry filled mess made by Mozilla.
#### [`KDE Connect`](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) Used to link your phone and your Linux or Windows PC together. Share files, clipboard history, and more.
#### [`qBittorent`](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) An open source torrent client.
#### [`RustDesk`](https://rustdesk.com/) An open source remote desktop application, written in Rust. (flatpak version, needs to updated manually by me)
#### [`Spicetify`](https://spicetify.app) Powerful CLI to take control of Spotify.
#### [`auto-cpufreq`](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) A tool to manage and monitor your CPU power output.

That's everything this script has to offer so far.

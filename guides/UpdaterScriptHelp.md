# Documentation on `Updater.sh`

Need some help with the updater script? I gotcha covered. Luckily, it's pretty easy. 
This uses `pacman` and `yay` to update the main packages and the AUR. 
If `yay` isnt installed, the script is so nice and installs it for you.
If it errors out, it will probably tell you what's up but lemme know either way.

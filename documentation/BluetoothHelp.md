# Documentation for `Bluetooth.sh`

Very short documentation. Not meant to be ran directly, but you can run it by itself using the curl command below.
``````
cd; curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strangetheproot/practical-shell-files/main/scripts/Bluetooth.sh && sudo bash Bluetooth.sh
``````
Grabs a few packages, it grabs `bluez`, `blueman`, `bluez-utils`. Enables the system service, and asks you to reboot to save changes. That's pretty much it.
